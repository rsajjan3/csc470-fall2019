# Final Project
## Game Design
### Plan
* The game will involve a player controlling a character to attack enemies spread out randomly throughout the randomly generated map. The player will need to navigate the map to find the enemies and attack them. Once a player has finished all the enemies on a map, they will progress to another level which will be more difficult. The player will have to navigate and attack all the players within a defined time limit. As the player progresses, the time limit will shrink. The game will essentially be navigating through a maze(generated by Game of Life?) and attacking enemies within a time limit. 
* The player will have controlled using point-and-click movement, they will have various attack options spread out amongst the number keys. Spacebar will act as an attack/fire button.
* The camera will be an overhead view, at an angle to the map(potentially top-down, testing needs to be done to see what's better)
* The visual style will be mostly flat colors and textures, similar to what Google Material Design looks like
* The interface will be similar to that of current point-and-click games(ex: League of Legands, Dota 2, Starcraft, etc.)
### Feature Set
#### Low Goal
* Player has multiple attack types, and has to attack enemies in the maze.
* Maze will be static(non-random)
* Enemies will be statically placed in the maze
#### Achievable Goal
* Maze is randomly generated
* Enemies are randomly placed in the maze
#### Stretch Goal
* Enemies will attack the player
* Enemies will move through the maze(path finding algorithm?)
* Enemy intelligence(movement and attacking) increases with each level
